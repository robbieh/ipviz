A tool to create visualizations of IPv6 addresses

Inspired by the VisualHostKey in SSH, this is for generating unique images based on IPv6 addresses.
Working with IPv4 is not so bad. The addresses are not that difficult to analyze. However, the size of IPv6 addresses
makes it much harder to distingush addresses, and to see when two addreses are the same.

Suggestions for how to visualize an address are very welcome!
